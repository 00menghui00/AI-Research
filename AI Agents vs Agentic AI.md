原文：https://arxiv.org/html/2505.10468?_immersive_translate_auto_translate=1

#### 核心概念：
1. AI Agents：modular systems driven and enabled by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor providing the foundation, with AI agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements.
2. Agentic AI systems：represent a paradigm shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and coordinated autonomy.
